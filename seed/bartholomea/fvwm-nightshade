= Development =
Here we provide a minimal development environment sufficient to build kernel
drivers, so that this is possible on the live CD and in scenarios where
it is problematic to get these packages onto the installed system in order
to compile a driver. -mdz

 * (gcc)
 * (make)

= Others =
Here are useful tools listed

 * vim                              # better version as tiny vim :P
